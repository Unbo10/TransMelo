## How to run modules

If you want to run `some/folder/file.py` and the file contains some import statements, you should do the following:

1. Go to the root directory of the project (e.g. `TransMelo/` if you named the directory as the repo)
2. Run `python -m some.folder.file`

> Note: Exporting the PYTHONPATH is not recommended.
